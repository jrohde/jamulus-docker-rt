            Jamulus is for playing, rehearsing, or just jamming with your friends, your band or just anyone you find online.
            More details: https://jamulus.io
            
            If you want to get the real-time capabilities of this app you should install a PREEMPT_RT kernel on your host machine!
            More details: https://github.com/2b-t/docker-realtime

            `Important!` If you are using CapRover version `1.10.1` or older, you will need to **override CapRover's configuration** to use the newer Docker API version `1.4.1` (this can be done manually or by running `echo "{\"dockerApiVersion\":\"v1.41\"}" > /captain/data/config-override.json`).
            Restart CapRover after this with `docker service update captain-captain --force`.
        end: |-
            Awesome, configuration is done. Only a few important steps more to do!
            
            1. Open udp port $$cap_jamulus_port in the uwf firewall on the host machine like this: `ufw allow $$cap_jamulus_port/udp`.
            2. Go to **App Configs** and paste the following snippet into **Service Update Override**: 
            `{"TaskTemplate":{"ContainerSpec":{"Hostname":"$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain","CapabilityAdd":["CAP_SYS_NICE","NET_ADMIN"],"Ulimits":[{"Rtprio":"99","Rttime":"-1","Memlock":"8428281856"}],"Hostname":"$$cap_appname.$$cap_root_domain","Healthcheck":{"Test":["CMD-SHELL","nc -zu localhost 22124 || exit 1"],"Interval":60000000000,"Retries":5,"StartPeriod":20000000000,"Timeout":10000000000}}}}` 
            3. Press **Save & Update**
            
            After that check the logs if your server is registered and fire up your Jamulus client (get it from https://jamulus.io/wiki/Getting-Started if you didn't install it yet).
            And see you're brand new jamulus server happy waiting in your chosen directory server ($$cap_jamulus_directory_server) for music to be made!
